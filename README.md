# Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit Converter
Welcome to the Kelvin Weather Converter! My name is Evy, and I'm the mad scientist behind this project. I've been toiling away in my mountain-side meteorology lab, working tirelessly to master weather prediction. Recently, I decided to share my weather forecasts with the world by publishing them on my website. However, there's a small issue: all of my forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin!

# Dog Years Calculator
Hello there! I'm excited to introduce you to the Dog Years Calculator, a fun tool to help you determine your age in "dog years." My name is Evy, and I'll be your guide as we explore this fascinating concept of age conversion for our furry friends.<br>

## Why Dog Years?
Dogs mature at a different rate than humans. You've probably heard the saying that a dog's age can be calculated in "dog years" to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In a way, we could say that time moves quickly for dogs, as 8 years in a human's life equate to a whopping 45 years in a dog's life. It's a bit mind-boggling, isn't it?

## How to Convert Your Age
So, you might be wondering, "How old would I be if I were a dog?" Well, that's where the Dog Years Calculator comes in handy. Converting your age from "human years" to "dog years" is quite simple. Here's how it works: <br>

### 1. The First Two Years: 
The first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each. These early years are filled with rapid growth and development, much like in humans.

### 2.Subsequent Years: 
Starting from year three and onwards, each additional year equates to 4 dog years. This rate accounts for the more gradual aging that dogs experience as they mature.
