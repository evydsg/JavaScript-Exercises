# Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit Converter
Welcome to the Kelvin Weather Converter! My name is Evy, and I'm the mad scientist behind this project.

Recently, I decided to share my weather forecasts with the world by publishing them on my website. However, there's a small issue: all of my forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin!
